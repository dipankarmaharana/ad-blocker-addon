#### save unique notes for every page. 

 

### problem statement. 

The pandemic has pushed us to go online. We come across online content on a daily basis. We keep on surfing various websites. But still, we rely on the physical paper for taking notes. 

 

### solution. 

We developed an add-on that stores our notes in the browser itself. It can store different notes for different web pages as same as sticky notes. 

 

### why itâ€™s better? 

Keeping all your texts in a single place referencing various websites can be cluttery. 

Lightweight and easy to use. 

 

### tech stack. 

We used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop this extension.
